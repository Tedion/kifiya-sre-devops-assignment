# Task 3: Incident Management and Reliability Governance

## Overview
This task provides a comprehensive incident response framework for managing and learning from service disruptions.

## Components

1. **Incident Response Plan** - Defines roles, escalation paths, and communication flows
2. **Runbook** - Step-by-step procedures for common failure scenarios
3. **Postmortem Template** - Structured format for documenting incidents and lessons learned

## Incident Response Process

### Phases
1. **Detection** - Automated alerts or user reports
2. **Triage** - Initial assessment and severity classification
3. **Response** - Incident commander assigned, team assembled
4. **Resolution** - Problem identified and fixed
5. **Postmortem** - Document learnings and improvements

### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Complete service outage, data loss, security breach
- **P1 (High)**: Major feature broken, significant performance degradation
- **P2 (Medium)**: Minor feature broken, some users affected
- **P3 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, workarounds available

## Usage

1. Follow the Incident Response Plan during active incidents
2. Use Runbooks for common failure scenarios
3. Complete Postmortem Template within 48 hours of resolution
